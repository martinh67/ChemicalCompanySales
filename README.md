# FPW2Assignment1

My week 2 assignment 1 for Fundamentals of Programming completed **22/11/2020**:

One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salespersonâ€™s gross sales for last week and will calculate and display that salesperson's earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a time.
